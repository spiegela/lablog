1.0
* record_select_field always searches on the latest string
* R.S. dialog closes on mousedown instead of click (because sometimes clicks are intercepted)
* R.S. layers over <select> boxes in IE 6
* record_select_field now opens R.S. even when the field loads with focus
* new :onchange option for record_select_field, to observe selection events

1.0rc1
* helpers complain if the controller they're configured for doesn't use recordselect
* when using keyboard navigation, hitting "enter" to select a record no longer submits the form
* if text field is empty when dialog is closed, then recordselect will empty the hidden field as well (lets you deselect)
* support for multiple selections (record_multi_select_helper)
* param-based search conditions are smarter - can search numeric fields as well
* using record_select_conditions_from_controller instead of conditions_for_collection. also added a new record_select_includes override method.
* helpers now accept a :class option
* fixed bug with url escaping when helpers were configured with multiple parameters
* new :label configuration option. it's a proc - the default one calls record.to_label (for backwards compatibility).
* cleaned up merge_conditions to use activerecord's sanitize_sql.
* div.record-select-container now has a high z-index so it will by default be visible above other absolutely positioned elements.
