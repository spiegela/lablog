path to 1.1.0
-- as of r639
=============

features
--------
boolean columns: when the database column allows nil, we now add a third option to the dropdown so you don't *have* to pick true or false.
fieldsearch module handles booleans better - provides third option so you don't *have* to search on a boolean column
row class: new helper method (list_row_class) gets called for each record in the list and returns a CSS class.
use #human_name for the column label when possible.
active_scaffold_includes now accepts a frontend name. this is necessary so you can include the proper assets even if active_scaffold isn't configured on the current controller (it's embedded).
merge_conditions now supports hash conditions (and should forever support every conditions style that ActiveRecord supports)
`render :active_scaffold' now accepts a :conditions option, which is a weaker but more flexible variation of :constraints
nested scaffolds now utilize the :conditions configured on associations
:through associations may now be nested
polymorphic constraints are now supported, assuming params[:parent_model].to_s is the proper content for the polymorphic _type field.
improved support for associations in parameters. for simply selecting/deselecting associations, activescaffold will now recognize `:user => 5' or `:users => [1, 2, 5]'.
action links:
  may now remove an action link with #clear_link
  new :controller option, so you don't have to sneak it into :params anymore
added after_update_save controller override method
dhtml history may now be disabled
inplace_edit option on list columns. currently works for text boxes, booleans ... ?
automatically link to the :show action of singular associations. this is similar to the nested scaffolds for plural associations.
no longer trying to nest a polymorphic association (there's no consistent model to list)
new :params option for a column lets you specify additional parameters to accept when the given column is on the form. this is for when a column needs to submit multiple values to work.
nested#shallow_delete: ... ?
file uploads
  ... details? ...
form_ui
  form interface options are now supported through helper method named active_scaffold_input_#{form_ui}. if you want a different form interface than activescaffold normally provides, you may configure the form_ui for that column to use one of these methods. you can easily define your own, too.
  new form interface options:
    :record_select - paginated/searchable interface for for singular and plural associations (requires recordselect plugin)
    :country
    :usa_state
    :textarea
    ... check form_column_helpers.rb for official list ...
also created list_ui, good for when you want to render multiple columns the same way.


bugfixes
--------
no longer blow up on data strings with unintentional % characters. as_() was sprintf'ing too frequently.
the calculation row now updates on edit/create/destroy.
link_to no longer blows up on controller symbols
constraints are now applied to a record during the #new action, in case any custom form rendering depends on the constrained column
list now returns to page 1 if the current page has no records.
list will now try to reload the scaffold on a previous page if you delete the last entry on the current page.
activescaffold no longer loses information on columns - `config.columns.add', `config.columns = [...]', and `config.columns.exclude' all now affect the *inheritability* of a column by the other modules (list, create, update, etc.), but all columns remain in config.columns. this also makes _id columns behave better.
dhtml history no longer saves null:null:null history bookmark.
if there were no end-of-line record actions, then any column actions would not use ajax. this was because the loading indicator was missing, which messed up the action link javascript.
if there aren't any columns to search on, then activescaffold no longer creates an empty WHERE clause
the default options_for_association_conditions now returns nil for :through associations
fixed :conditions generation for nested/embedded scaffolds - was causing a bind variable mismatch.
will not update a record attribute if the value hasn't changed. this is a workaround for an activerecord bug with has_one associations.
attributes_hash_is_empty? didn't handle multi-parameter attribute names like 'created_at(5i)', which resulted in extra records being created from subforms.
render :update was failing in some cases because activescaffold wasn't expecting blocks to the render call.
theme == :default no longer attempts to use Rico.Corner
column_empty? now treats any values equal to list.empty_field_text as empty, too.
search/livesearch should no longer choke on virtual columns
better :method handling for action links.

misc
--------
reorganized the helpers and extensions
ui_type is now an alias for form_ui
improvements to exception messages
when initializing in production mode, activescaffold now recovers gracefully if it can't copy asset files
RESTful routing is now accomplished in a way that'll let other add-ons extend the meaning of :active_scaffold => true.
fixes for edge rails compatibility
small improvements for localization accessibility
minor string renaming (will affect localization tables, though)
